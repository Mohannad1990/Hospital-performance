#PowerBI Project 1: Hospital Performance Analysis 

I'm excited to share my recent Power BI project, which I developed from DataCamp. This interactive report provides a comprehensive analysis of hospital performance, focusing on key metrics such as Average Length of Stay (LOS) and Cost per Discharge.

üîç Key Insights:
-Average LOS and Total Discharges: The dashboard displays the Average Length of Stay (LOS) and the total number of discharges for the top 15 hospitals. Notably, hospitals like Kings County and Memorial Hospital have higher average LOS, indicating more complex cases or patient conditions.
-Cost Comparison: A comparative analysis of the Average Cost per Discharge across hospitals reveals significant variations. For instance, NYU Lutheran Medical Center shows the highest cost per discharge, which may be attributed to specialized treatments or higher resource utilization.
-Influencing Factors: The report also highlights factors that influence both LOS and cost. Factors such as the severity of illness, risk of mortality, and patient disposition significantly impact these metrics. For example, higher severity of illness correlates with increased LOS and cost.
-Regional Differences: There are noticeable regional differences in healthcare costs and outcomes. Hospitals in New York City tend to have higher costs per discharge, while regions like the Southern Tier have lower costs, suggesting varying healthcare strategies and resource allocations.
-Patient Outcomes and Diagnoses: The report breaks down total discharges by patient disposition, severity of illness, and common diagnoses. This helps identify trends in patient care and hospital efficiency, offering valuable insights for healthcare administrators.

üí° Tools and Techniques Used:
-Data Visualization: Utilized Power BI to create interactive charts and graphs for easy comparison and trend analysis.
-Key Influencer Analysis: Identified key factors driving costs and LOS using Power BI's AI capabilities.
-Regional Analysis: Leveraged filters and slicers to drill down into specific regions and hospitals for detailed insights
